Minesweeper Logic

Known

X If the number of unknown squares = number of remaining mines, all are mines (end game)

X If remaining mines = 0, all unknown are safe (all mines found, but some unknown squares remain)

If box's number - touching mines (check for >0) = number of unknown squares, then unknown are mines


If box's number = touching mines, all other unknown squares are not mines


When I flag something, all its adjacent cells must have that cell removed from adjacent unknowns 
and moved to adjacent mines




Questionable
-Random Start
Nove to smallest group of unknowns
-Move to corners
	-Identify corners 
		-Number - touching mines = 1
		-other option is a working number that is surrounded by 3x 0's
		-Outside corners are always 1's, maybe examine 1's first?
-after labeling a mine, check to update all touching numbers to possibly move WN to Done
-after making a move, examine touching squares

If number - touching mines is > touching unknowns, not enough info, move on to next working number

-maybe categorize squares as:
	-Done
	-Working Numbers
	-Unknown
	-Mine
